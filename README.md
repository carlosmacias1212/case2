# Data Set:
The data is read in from a csv file. The data describes multiple characteristics of individual loans including job titles, employment length, loan amount, etc. Overall the data set did not seem to be fully normalized which may not be an issue if it is read only. There were some records that contained null values which could negatively affect data queries. Another issue when it comes to reading in the csv file into a database is that for the technologies that I used it took a long time to load in the data and not all of it was able to be inserted into the table. 

# Feature Set:
The feature set created was related to the 5 visualizations and the data that would be coming in and out of those functions given some parts of the data displayed in each individual graph/chart.
